                <h3>My name is Lesedi Rwicila</h3>
                <p style="font-size:20px ;" >
                        I am a User Interface / User Experience  designer & developer based in South Africa.
                        <br> Even though I am based in South Africa I am more than willing to move anywhere in the World.
                        <br>I am currently studying UI/UX design and development at a private institution that is 
                         <br>partners with Microsoft. I have always been a very creative person that loves drawing, writing 
                        <br>and design but is also logical. So when I descovered Web Development and what it entailed in 
                         <br>high school I immediately fell in love. In this course, which I am currently doing my final year,
                         <br>I have learned being creative and logical is really beneficial in creating not only aesthetically 
                         <br>pleasing websites and apps but also functional ones. And as a bonus working as both a designer
                         <br>and developer allows me to make sure no detail is lost in translation. 
                         <br>Check out my work in my portfolio page and feel free to contact me detail and links are provided below.

                <h3>Incredible work ethic</h3>
                <p>Remember whilst in high-school people always adviced you to choose a career that you will enjoy doing everyday?
                    Well for me Web Developement/Front-end Software development and UI/UX design & development is what I truly enjoy doing. 
                   <br> I have many hobbies and interests that I love doing and creating websites, application and games is part of my hobbies.
                    One thing you should know about me is if I enjoy doing something I do everything with in my power to perfect it.  
                    So yes I may be a Junior developer but I have the work ethic of an artist that is trying to create their masterpiece. 
                </p>

                <div class="text-card">
                    <h3>My extensive skillset</h3>
                    <p> As I said before I am currently studying at a institution that is partners with Microsoft.
                         This allows me to get certification that is internationally recognized. 
                        <br> Although I am doing a course on Web Developement, I do a wide range subjects that bleed into many other career 
                         options. For example I have done a module on game development where we learnt about the fundamentals of game development and also created game environments using Unity. 
                        <br> At the end of this year I will have to make a fully functional game using Unity as a final project. 
                         I also have done Social media Marketing which caused me to work with Photoshop a lot and have learnt a wide range of computer languages such as: HTML, CSS, Java,
                         JavaScrip, PHP, SQL, C# and Angular js. So I may be still a junior developer with a lot to learn but I have a solid fondation.

                        <h3>My people skills</h3>
                        <p>I tend to be a very quiet and shy individul, but once I get used to a group of people or if I need to be social in order to complete a task I am suprisingly a nice person to be around. 
                            As I said before I feel like I am a shy individual but if you were to ask people that I see on a daily basis they would tell you something completely different. From what I have heard 
                           <br> from others when they describe the type of person I am they usually use the words: geeky, loud, weird, funny and helpful. 
                            As much I may view myself as not a people person but I do truly enjoy working with others and being part of a team, I sometimes miss working with others whilst working on a solo project, 
                            <br> and its not because of the companionship but its also because I understand the value of workiing in teams, especially as a developer, because 
                            as much as we as developers tend to think that we can do everything by ourselves that is not always true.
